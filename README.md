# Tailwind CSS Hover Effects Not Working

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where hover effects fail to work on child elements when the parent container has a background color set.  The issue seems to stem from specificity conflicts or z-index issues, particularly when using certain Tailwind utility classes.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, exhibiting the hover effect problem. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with a potential solution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a development server (e.g., using Vite, Webpack, etc.).
3. Observe that the button's hover effect (changing background color) does not work as expected in `bug.js`.
4. Compare to the corrected functionality in `bugSolution.js`

## Possible Solution

The likely solution involves adjusting the specificity of your CSS rules or using the `!important` flag (though use this cautiously).  The `bugSolution.js` file presents one such solution.  More sophisticated approaches might include more detailed analysis of CSS specificity or employing a more structured approach to class naming to mitigate specificity conflicts.  Consider using Tailwind's `@layer` to control CSS layering and potentially resolve this problem.
